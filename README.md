  I have used a Media Query of 567 for mobile view.

## API Integration

This project uses the RapidAPI for COVID-19 to fetch the latest statistics. The JavaScript `fetch` function is used to make API requests and update the user interface with the received data.

### API Endpoint

- Endpoint: [API Endpoint URL](https://covid-193.p.rapidapi.com/statistics)

### Example API Request

```javascript
fetch('https://covid-193.p.rapidapi.com/statistics', {
method: 'GET',
headers: {
 'X-RapidAPI-Key': 'your_api_key_here'
}
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
 // Update UI with data
})
.catch(error => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));


### How the Javascript code works:

The JavaScript code in this project is responsible for fetching the latest COVID-19 statistics using the RapidAPI. It dynamically updates the user interface with the retrieved data based on user interaction.

### `onLoad` Function

The `onLoad` function is immediately invoked when the page loads. It sets up button functions and fetches the latest COVID-19 data.

### `setButtonFunctions` Function

The `setButtonFunctions` function sets up an event listener for the `countries` dropdown. When a country is selected, the function filters the COVID-19 data to find the selected country's data and updates the UI accordingly.

### `getLatestCOVID19Data` Function

The `getLatestCOVID19Data` function makes a `GET` request to the COVID-19 statistics API using the Fetch API. It populates the `countries` dropdown with all available countries and saves the retrieved COVID-19 data to the `covid19data` global variable.
